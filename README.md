# Mie-swf

This repository is for the collaborative effort to develop a Mie switch-force force field for organic compounds using vapor-liquid equilibria data.

The primary optimization tool is Multistate Bennett Acceptance Ratio which can be used with Isothermal isochoric integration (ITIC) and Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) as a substitute for traditional histogram reweighting.
